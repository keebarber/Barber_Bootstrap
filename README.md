# Barber_Bootstrap
Part 3 of the application process for the Facebook sponsored Grand Rapids' Grand Circus Bootcamp was to build a website about your favorite TV show using the Bootstrap framework. 
Unfortunately, due to my job at the time, I had precious few hours to work on it over a few days and it didn't quite turn out as planned. 

It is good to look back from time to time - but only to see how far we've truly come.
